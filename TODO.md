1. Impliment adjacency matrix change so that each node per step can only have one connection (communities no larger than 2)

2. Impliment averaging of all the simulation runs, return list of all the infection arrays, and then plot as a function of time 
- vairy params like size of matrix, number agents ect.

3. Impliment graph viz stuff 

4. Fit equasions / research theory for the erdos-something graph structure. 

5. Barabasi graph look at  




24.11.2022

1. Look at the 'causal' case of edges turning on and off for the edge by edge saturation behaviour of networks
2. Look at the 'reachability' matrix of all nodes in the graph as a function of the timesteps for this 

Extentions: 
1. Look at:
    variable length timesteps
    nodes being able to turn off 
    various edge weights 
    different distributions of static graph structures
